# Host integration in Angular Workflow Designer

Some steps need work that only your application can do, such as sending a notification or running custom logic. For these steps, the designer triggers an event, and the step waits until your handler finishes it.

The arguments of these events contain the following members:

* `complete(result)`: Finishes the step successfully. The value you pass becomes the step's response, which later steps can read.
* `fail(error)`: Fails the step with the given `Error`. The step is reported as failed in the execution log and in the `executionStepFailed` event.
* `signal`: An `AbortSignal` that's aborted when the run is stopped or the step times out. Pass it to your own requests so they're cancelled too.

Only the first call to `complete` or `fail` takes effect. The step waits until one of them is called, the step times out, or the run is stopped.

## Notifications

Handle the `notifyRequested` event to deliver the notifications that Notify steps send. When no handler is bound to this event, Notify steps fail.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkflowDesignerModule } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-workflow-designer';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [WorkflowDesignerModule],
    template: "<ejs-workflowdesigner id=\"workflow\" height=\"500px\" (notifyRequested)=\"onNotifyRequested($event)\"></ejs-workflowdesigner>"
})
export class AppComponent {

    onNotifyRequested(args: any): void {
        fetch('/api/notify', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ stepId: args.step.id, notification: args.notification }), signal: args.signal })
            .then((response: Response) => { if (!response.ok) { args.fail(new Error('Notification failed with HTTP ' + response.status)); return; } args.complete({ sent: true }); })
            .catch((error: Error) => args.fail(error));
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The event arguments contain the following properties, in addition to `complete`, `fail`, and `signal`:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `step` | The Notify step. |
| `notification` | The step's notification settings, with expressions already resolved. `channel` and `message` are always set; the other fields depend on the channel. See [Notify](./workflow-steps#notify). |
| `stepResults` | The results of the steps that ran so far, in run order. |
| `previousStep` | The result of the step that ran just before, if any. |

Values from earlier steps are inserted into `args.notification` as they are. Escape them before you use them in HTML, such as an email body. Call `fail` for every unsuccessful outcome, including HTTP error responses, so the run reports the failure. If you call `complete`, the step is treated as successful.

## Custom steps

Handle the `customExecutionRequested` event to run the work of Custom steps. `actionType` identifies the action, and `input` holds the step's input with expressions already resolved. When no handler is bound to this event, Custom steps fail.

The following sample handles a Custom step that creates a mock invoice and calls `complete` with the invoice data:

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/samples/diagram-sdk/angular/workflow-designer/host-integration" %}

## Credentials

Keep production secrets on your server. Only credential names, never secrets, are saved in a workflow. To authenticate requests:

* For API Request steps, add the authentication header in the `beforeRequestSend` event, or route the request through your backend, which adds the credentials.
* For AI steps and AI Assist, use the default `'Reference'` credential mode with a backend endpoint that holds the provider key. See [Credential mode](./security#credential-mode).

## Intercept requests

The `beforeRequestSend` event is triggered before every request that an API Request step, an AI step, or AI Assist sends. `requestType` is `'ApiRequest'`, `'AI'`, or `'AIAssist'`. Use the event to:

* Change `args.request` in place, for example, to route the URL through your proxy or add headers. Headers are a list of `{ key, value }` pairs.
* Supply the response yourself by setting `args.response` to a value or a promise. No request is sent.
* Block the request by setting `args.cancel` to `true`. The step then fails with the code `REQUEST_CANCELLED`.

The following example blocks API requests to any host other than your own API, and adds an authorization header to the allowed requests:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkflowDesignerModule } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-workflow-designer';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [WorkflowDesignerModule],
    template: "<ejs-workflowdesigner id=\"workflow\" height=\"500px\" (beforeRequestSend)=\"onBeforeRequestSend($event)\"></ejs-workflowdesigner>"
})
export class AppComponent {

    onBeforeRequestSend(args: any): void {
        if (args.requestType === 'ApiRequest') {
            const request = args.request;
            if (!request.url.startsWith('https://api.mycompany.com/')) {
                args.cancel = true;
                return;
            }
            // getUserToken stands for your application's sign-in code.
            request.headers = (request.headers || []).concat([
                { key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer ' + getUserToken() }
            ]);
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Edit-time events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflowChanged` | Triggered after the workflow changes, in the UI or through `importWorkflow`. The arguments provide a `workflow` snapshot, the `changeType`, the `affectedItem`, and the `changedProperties`. |
| `selectionChanged` | Triggered when the selection on the canvas changes. `selectedItem` holds the selected step, connection, or sticky note, or `null` when the selection is cleared. |

The following example saves a draft of the workflow whenever it changes:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}

import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { WorkflowDesignerModule, WorkflowDesignerComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-workflow-designer';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [WorkflowDesignerModule],
    template: "<ejs-workflowdesigner #workflow id=\"workflow\" height=\"500px\" (workflowChanged)=\"onWorkflowChanged($event)\"></ejs-workflowdesigner>"
})
export class AppComponent {
    @ViewChild('workflow') public workflowDesigner!: WorkflowDesignerComponent;

    onWorkflowChanged(args: any): void {
        console.log('Workflow changed:', args.changeType);
        // saveDraft stands for your application's save code.
        saveDraft(this.workflowDesigner.exportWorkflow());
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
