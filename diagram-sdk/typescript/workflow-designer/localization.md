# Localization in EJ2 TypeScript Workflow Designer

You can localize all text in the Workflow Designer, including labels, tooltips, validation messages, and run errors. Load the translations under the `workflow-designer` module name with `L10n.load`, and then set the `locale` property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}

import { L10n } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';
import { WorkflowDesigner } from '@syncfusion/ej2-workflow-designer';

L10n.load({
    'de-DE': {
        'workflow-designer': {
            'workflowSteps': 'Workflow-Schritte',
            'searchWorkflowSteps': 'Workflow-Schritte suchen',
            'categoryTriggers': 'Auslöser',
            'categoryActions': 'Aktionen',
            'executionLog': 'Ausführungsprotokoll',
            'executionCompleted': 'Ausführung abgeschlossen',
            'cancel': 'Abbrechen'
        }
    }
});

const designer: WorkflowDesigner = new WorkflowDesigner({ locale: 'de-DE' });
designer.appendTo('#workflowDesigner');

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Keys that aren't translated fall back to English. When you change `locale` at runtime, every panel updates. Several designers on one page can use different locales.

## Default locale

The following table lists all 472 localization keys and their default English text. Some keys, such as `'Action Type'` and `'Time Zone'`, are the English labels themselves and contain spaces. Use them exactly as shown, in quotes, in your `L10n.load` object.
