# Import and Export in EJ2 TypeScript Workflow Designer

Workflows are saved and loaded as JSON. A workflow contains the `id`, `name`, `workflowSteps`, `workflowConnections`, and `stickyNotes` properties. Exported JSON also contains a `schemaVersion` value that identifies its format; keep it unchanged when you store the JSON.

## Export

To get the current workflow as a JSON string, call [`exportWorkflow`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/workflow-designer/#exportworkflow). You can then store the string, for example in your database:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}

const json: string = designer.exportWorkflow();
// myApi stands for your application's save endpoint.
myApi.save(json);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Users can also export the workflow as a JSON file with the **Export** toolbar command or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

N> Secrets are never exported. This includes inline AI keys and the values of sensitive request headers: `Authorization`, and header names that contain `secret`, `token`, or `password`. The credential name in `authRef` is kept. In `'Inline'` credential mode, users must enter AI keys again after an import.

## Import

[`importWorkflow`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/workflow-designer/#importworkflow) accepts a JSON string, a workflow object, or a `File`, and returns a promise. The following example imports a file that the user selects:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}

import { WorkflowImportError } from '@syncfusion/ej2-workflow-designer';

const input: HTMLInputElement = document.getElementById('fileInput') as HTMLInputElement;
input.addEventListener('change', () => {
    designer.importWorkflow(input.files[0]).catch((error: WorkflowImportError) => {
        console.error(error.code, error.message);
    });
});

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Users can also import a JSON file with the **Import** toolbar command or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>.

When the import succeeds, any active run is stopped, the workflow is replaced, and the canvas is fitted to the page. When the import fails, the promise rejects with a `WorkflowImportError`, and the current workflow is left unchanged. The error's `code` tells you why:

| Code | Reason |
|---|---|
| `IMPORT_INVALID_JSON` | The input isn't valid JSON. |
| `IMPORT_TOO_LARGE` | The file or JSON is larger than 5 MB. |
| `IMPORT_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` | The JSON doesn't have a supported `schemaVersion` value. Workflows exported by the Workflow Designer always have one. |
| `IMPORT_IDS` | A step, connection, or sticky note has an empty or duplicated identifier. |
| `IMPORT_INVALID` | The JSON doesn't have the shape of a workflow, for example, `workflowSteps` isn't an array. |
| `IMPORT_INVALID_STRUCTURE` | The workflow has a structural error, such as a duplicate identifier or a cycle. The error's `messages` property lists the problems. See [Validation on import](./validation#validation-on-import). |

## Update a step from code

To change a step, connection, or sticky note, call [`updateWorkflowItem`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/workflow-designer/#updateworkflowitem) with its identifier and the properties to change. Only the properties you pass are updated, and the `id` can't be changed:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}

designer.updateWorkflowItem('getOrder', {
    name: 'Get order details',
    props: { method: 'GET', url: 'https://api.mycompany.com/orders/1' }
});

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The method returns `true` when the item is updated. It returns `false` and does nothing when the designer is read-only or no item has the given identifier. By default, the change triggers the `workflowChanged` event; pass `true` as the third argument to update the item without triggering it.
